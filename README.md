# TRY-a-nfT-lotteRY
The goal of the project is to implement TRY, a lottery offering users collectibles  as winning prizes.
The rules of the lottery are inspired by Powerball, a popular  type of lottery played in the United States.
The lottery logic is implemented with a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Before  operating the lottery, the lottery manager buys a batch of collectibles, mints a Non Fungible Token (NFT) for each of them.
Each lotteryâ€™s winner may receive as a prize one of thesecollectibles.

This contract has been developed using the IDE Remix with Ganache as provider for the blockchain.

* **lotteryNFT.sol**: contract of the NFT lottery.
* **NFT_KITTY.sol**: contract use to generate the NFT using the ERC721 standard for Non Fungible Token
* **lottery_test.js**: JS script to test the code, using remix test unit
* **lottery.zip**: it contains the remix workspace use to develop the project.
  * To run it, just import the zip to Remix using the GUI



# LogObject
PREDICTIVE POLICING PROJECT WITH LOGOBJECT

* **st_gallen_analysis.ipynb** : project code runnable directly with Jupyter 
   * We recommend installing the **complete package for Jupyter**, available from the official Anaconda website, which contains all the libraries used for the project( direct link to the download page: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual )
   * After installing Jupyter, you can simply import the file and run it ( we suggest running the entire code with **Run Cells**, because partial execution of one cell could raise some issues)
  
* **db.csv** - **st_gallen_export.json** : dataset used for the analysis
  (this two files contain the same data, but in two differnt format)
  
* **Logobject_database_analysis.pdf** : presentation of the project analysis
