# TRY-a-nfT-lotteRY
The goal of the project is to implement TRY, a lottery offering users collectibles  as winning prizes.
The rules of the lottery are inspired by Powerball, a popular  type of lottery played in the United States.
The lottery logic is implemented with a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
Before  operating the lottery, the lottery manager buys a batch of collectibles, mints a Non Fungible Token (NFT) for each of them.
Each lotteryâ€™s winner may receive as a prize one of thesecollectibles.

This contract has been developed using the IDE Remix with Ganache as provider for the blockchain.
